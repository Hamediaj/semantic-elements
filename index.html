    <h3>Semantic Elements:</h3>
      <p><mark>Semantic elements makes it easier for people to be able to read and understand HTML. The reason we use semantic elements is for numerous reasons. For one, it means to have clearer code and if you have clear code then it is easier to maintain for you and others working on the same project. Secondly, it helps the site to be more accessible. If you use the correct tags for elements then it allows it to be easier for users to navigate. Lastly, semantic elements is important because of interoperability.  This will allow systems and software to be able to exchange information between one another.</mark> </p>
